# FakeFaaS
FakeFaaS is an experimental platform for prototyping some faas-related things,
especially GPU support (including kernel as a service). The code is provided as
a python package under python/ which also includes unit tests. The examples
directory contains various experiments and example applications.

## Quickstart
See python/README.md for a quickstart for libff. Once the tests described there
pass, you can start playing with the stuff in examples/ (note that not all of
those are guaranteed to work, only use the ones you actually care about).
